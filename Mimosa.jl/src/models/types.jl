    AbstractMotifModel

Abstract supertype of all motif model families (PWM, PFM, BaMM, SiteGA, etc.).
Motif models can be scanned against encoded sequences. Precomputed profiles are
`AbstractProfileSource`s, but are not motif models.

A custom model subtypes `AbstractMotifModel` and implements the minimal
contract described in `docs/src/extending.md` and ADR 0003:

- `modelname(model)::AbstractString`
- `motif_length(model)::Integer`
- `scan_pair_kernel!(forward, reverse, model, sequence, n_positions)` (or
  specialized `scan_forward!`/`scan_reverse!`/`scan_both!` methods)

`left_context` and `right_context` default to zero. `window_size`,
`npositions`, and `site_start_offset` are derived by Mimosa.jl.
"""
abstract type AbstractMotifModel <: AbstractProfileSource end

"""Return whether `model` has a direct sequence-scanning implementation.

This is a transitional compatibility shim. Subtyping
`AbstractMotifModel` is itself the scannability declaration; new model
types do not need to define `is_scannable` and the function may be
deprecated in a future breaking release.
