## 1-vs-50 Profile Comparison Benchmark

The `bench_1v50.jl` script measures end-to-end performance of the one-to-many
profile comparison scenario: **1 query model vs 50 target models** on random
DNA sequences.

For a direct Julia/Python comparison, `cross_language_profile.py` generates one
shared FASTA file and one shared 51-motif MEME file. It excludes input loading
and JIT warm-up from timing, then measures query scan/preparation plus target
scan, normalization, and alignment. The JSON report records serial and threaded
median/minimum times and Julia speedup relative to Python.

### Cross-language results (2026-07-13, optimized pipeline)

Environment: Intel Core i7-11370H (4 cores/8 threads), Julia 1.12.6,
Python 3.13.12, NumPy 2.3.5, Numba 0.65.0. Values are medians of three runs
after one warm-up and are machine-specific, not release thresholds.

| Runtime | 1 thread | 4 threads | 1-to-4 speedup |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Python | 19.493 s | 11.418 s | 1.71x |
| Julia | 13.480 s | 5.336 s | 2.53x |

Julia was 1.45x faster in serial and 2.14x faster with four threads for this
end-to-end compute scope. Target-level parallelism is now visible in both
implementations; normalization remains the largest isolated stage.

### Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Sequence length | 100 bp |
| Number of sequences | 10 000 |
| Number of targets | 50 |
| PWM width | 15 |
| Metric | CO (overlap coefficient) |
| Search range | 10 |
| Window radius | 5 |
| Repetitions per measurement | 3 |

### Running

```bash
# Serial (1 thread)
JULIA_NUM_THREADS=1 julia --project=Mimosa.jl/benchmark Mimosa.jl/benchmark/bench_1v50.jl

# Threaded (4 threads)
JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4 julia --project=Mimosa.jl/benchmark Mimosa.jl/benchmark/bench_1v50.jl
```

### Results

**Environment:** Julia 1.12.6, x86_64 Linux, 8 logical cores.

#### Component timings (median, 1 thread)

| Stage | Time |
|-------|------|
| Sequence generation (10 000 × 100 bp) | 3.8 ms |
| Query scan (BestStrand, 10 000 × 100, w=15) | 14.3 ms |
| Query profile preparation (normalization + anchors) | 275.0 ms |
| Single target scan | 13.6 ms |
| Target precompute (50 models, scan + profile) | 919.5 ms (18.4 ms/model) |

#### Historical comparison timings (median)

These results predate explicit `ExecutionPolicy` selection. The old benchmark
started Julia with four threads but still called APIs with their default
`SerialExecution()`, so the 4-thread column is not a threaded-library result.

| Mode | 1 thread | 4 threads |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| 1-vs-1 (profiles precomputed) | 372 ms | 344 ms |
| **1-vs-50 (profiles precomputed)** | **19 301 ms** | **17 584 ms** |
| 1-vs-50 end-to-end (scan + compare) | 25 117 ms | 22 792 ms |

#### Throughput and per-target cost

| Metric | 1 thread | 4 threads |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Per-target (pure comparison) | 386 ms/target | 352 ms/target |
| Per-target (end-to-end) | 502 ms/target | 456 ms/target |
| Throughput (pure comparison) | 3 comparisons/sec | 3 comparisons/sec |
| Throughput (end-to-end) | 2 comparisons/sec | 2 comparisons/sec |
| Speedup (50 vs 50×1-vs-1, pure) | 1.0× | 1.0× |

### Conclusions

1. **1-vs-50 comparison takes ~19 seconds** (pure comparison with precomputed
   profiles) and **~25 seconds** end-to-end (including target scanning). The
   throughput is **2–3 comparisons per second**.

2. **The bottleneck is profile preparation, not scanning or comparison.**
   Fitting the `EmpiricalLogTail` normalization over ~1.72 million scores
   (10 000 sequences × 86 positions × 2 strands) costs ~275 ms per profile —
   roughly **20× slower** than the PWM scan itself (~14 ms). The actual
   `profile_compare` call is negligible relative to preparation.

3. **Scanning is very fast.** A PWM scan over 10 000 × 100 bp sequences
   completes in ~14 ms. Precomputing all 50 target profiles (scan + profile
   build) takes ~920 ms total (~18 ms/model).

4. The historical ~1.1× result did not exercise `ThreadedExecution`. Current
   measurements must pass `execution=ThreadedExecution(n)` explicitly and
   record both `Threads.nthreads()` and the selected policy.

5. **No scaling advantage from batching.** The 1-vs-50 time is exactly 50× the
   1-vs-1 time (speedup = 1.0×), confirming that each target is processed
   independently with no shared work reuse beyond the query profile.

### Sample comparison output

```

pwm_w15_s12447: score=0.4977 offset=-1 orient=++ n_sites=16619
pwm_w15_s12448: score=0.4922 offset=-5 orient=++ n_sites=15654
pwm_w15_s12449: score=0.5381 offset= 0 orient=++ n_sites=16738

```

## Regression baseline (E2)

The `baseline.json` file stores per-benchmark median timings for regression
comparison. Per `PLAN_2.md` E2:

- The baseline should be stored for a **controlled machine** or compared using
  stable normalized metrics.
- Scheduled CI publishes a comparison report but **does NOT block PRs** on noisy
  microbenchmarks.
- RC gate blocks only on **confirmed regressions** of agreed representative
  workloads.
- Any optimization change must include profile evidence and a compatibility rerun.

### Updating the baseline

```bash
# On a controlled machine with stable configuration:
julia --project=Mimosa.jl/benchmark Mimosa.jl/benchmark/runbenchmarks.jl \
  --output Mimosa.jl/benchmark/baseline.json
```

### Comparing against baseline

```bash
julia --project=Mimosa.jl/benchmark Mimosa.jl/benchmark/runbenchmarks.jl \
  --baseline Mimosa.jl/benchmark/baseline.json
```

Results with a ratio > 1.25× are flagged as potential regressions.

## Legacy benchmark file

The older `benchmarks.jl` file (Stage 9) is kept for backwards compatibility
but `runbenchmarks.jl` supersedes it with full PLAN_2.md E1/E2 coverage
including machine-readable JSON output, environment metadata, and baseline
comparison.

The `bench_1v50.jl` script is a standalone targeted benchmark for the
1-vs-50 profile comparison scenario. It is not part of the full
`runbenchmarks.jl` suite but can be run independently as described in the
[1-vs-50 Profile Comparison Benchmark](#1-vs-50-profile-comparison-benchmark)
section above.
